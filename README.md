**How to build**
------------

Currently you need **4** components to build the Aurora Game Hub.

- **First** you need the **Aurora Core** which is whats hosted on this repository.

- **Second** you need the **[Aurora Engine](https://github.com/sguergachi/AuroraEngine)** which is an application engine built from ground up being developed in parallel to the Aurora Game Hub to assist in building great Java desktop apps faster.

- **Third** you need a **Surface** which is the name we use to refer to the modular and customizable skin being implemented through Aurora Engine. The default surface for Aurora Game Hub is the [Onix Surface](https://github.com/sguergachi/OnixSurface "Onix Surface")

- **Fourth** you need the [H2 Database Engine](http://h2database.com "H2 Database Engine"), which is the current JDBC SQL database Aurora Game Hub uses
